Debian Issue Solved
If you see:

go
Copy code
error: externally-managed-environment
It means your environment is system-managed.
You can solve this by installing required modules:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt install python3-scapy
sudo apt install python3-django
sudo apt install python3-tkinter
Or, create a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv path/to/venv
source path/to/venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
What is DDOS Attack?
DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) is a type of cyber-attack used to make an online service, network resource, or host unavailable to its users. Targets are flooded with excessive requests, overwhelming the server and its resources. DDoS attacks originate from multiple sources, unlike regular DoS attacks.



Types Of DDOS Attacks
1. Application Layer Attacks
Attackers repeatedly request the same resource to overwhelm the server. Common example: HTTP flood attacks.



2. Protocol Attacks
Exhausts server/network resources like firewalls or load balancers. Example: SYN flood attack.



3. Volumetric Attacks
Floods server bandwidth to make it unavailable. Example: DNS amplification attack.



DDOS Threats
DDoS attacks are often executed by botnets. Hackers coordinate thousands of devices to flood a target. Attack tools like WebHive LOIC, originally for “stresser testing”, can take commercial websites offline if coordinated.

DDOS Challenges
🔴 Attacks use DNS floods, bandwidth exhaustion, or cloud exploitation.

🔴 Lower-intensity service degradation attacks are harder to detect.

🔴 IoT devices increase network entryways for attacks.

🔴 Endpoint monitoring tools are critical for mitigation.

🔴 87% of DDoS victims are targeted multiple times.

Why do DDoS Attacks Happen?
👉 Ransom: Attackers demand money after attacks or send prior threats.

👉 Hacktivism: Attacks are used to voice opinions or protests.

👉 Competition: Companies sometimes blame competitors for attacks.

Prevent DDOS Attack
💀 Real-time packet analysis: Discard potentially malicious packets.

💀 DDoS Defense System (DDS): Detects malicious content automatically.

💀 Web Application Firewall (WAF): Filters incoming requests at the application layer.

💀 Rate Limiting: Restrict number of requests over time.
