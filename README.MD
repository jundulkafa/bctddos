python3 hulk.py


For Termux (Android)
bash
Copy code
# Update packages
pkg update && pkg upgrade -y

# Install Python & Git
pkg install python git -y

# Clone Repository
git clone https://github.com/jundulkafa/bctddos.git
cd bctddos

python hulk.py
⚠️ Debian / Ubuntu Issue
If you see:

go
Copy code
error: externally-managed-environment
You can fix this by installing required modules:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt install python3-scapy python3-django python3-tkinter -y
Or create a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
🌐 What is a DDoS Attack?
DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) is a cyber-attack used to make an online service, network resource, or host unavailable to its users. The target is overwhelmed by excessive requests from multiple sources.

⚡ Types of DDoS Attacks
1️⃣ Application Layer Attacks
Attackers repeatedly request the same resource to overload the server. Example: HTTP floods.

2️⃣ Protocol Attacks
Exhausts server/network resources like firewalls or load balancers. Example: SYN flood.

3️⃣ Volumetric Attacks
Floods server bandwidth. Example: DNS amplification attack.

💣 DDoS Threats
Executed via botnets controlling thousands of devices.

Tools like WebHive LOIC can take large websites offline when coordinated.

🚨 DDoS Challenges
🔴 DNS floods, bandwidth exhaustion, or cloud exploitation.

🔴 Low-intensity “degradation of service” attacks can bypass detection.

🔴 IoT devices increase attack vectors.

🔴 Endpoint monitoring is critical.

🔴 87% of victims are attacked multiple times.

❓ Why do DDoS Attacks Happen?
💰 Ransom: Attackers demand payment after attacks.

✊ Hacktivism: To voice opinions or protests.

⚔️ Competition: Companies blame rivals for attacks.

🛡️ How to Prevent DDoS Attacks
🕵️ Real-time packet analysis: Detect & drop malicious traffic.

🔰 DDoS Defense System (DDS): Automatic threat mitigation.

🛡️ Web Application Firewall (WAF): Filter application layer requests.

⏱️ Rate Limiting: Limit requests per time interval.
